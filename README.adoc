= Angular with jQuery Datatables Demo

This project demonstrates how to use https://datatables.net/[jQuery Datatables] in an Angular project with only jQuery and Datatables (and Bootstrap 4).

Yes, I know there are alternatives to Datatables so that you can drop jQuery usage with Angular.
And I would certainly prefer and advise that route when starting a new project.
But there definitely are situations where migration to an Angular based Datatable solution may not be the quickest and easiest,
especially if you have many existing Datatables, and so you are forced to keep using Datatables.

== Demonstrations
* Zero configuration from dom sourced data
* Javascript sourced data
* Ajax sourced data
* Server-side processing

 Note: It may take a few seconds for the app to start if no one has not accessed it recently
